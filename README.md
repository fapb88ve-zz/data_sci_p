# Projects
This is a collections of projects I decided to undertake. Most of these are of the Data Science variety (cleaning data, machine learning, etc.). The following abbreviations are meant to help the reader find the projects based on the interest they desire to find:

a) Data Cleaning (DC)

b) Machine Learning (ML)

c) Data Visualization (DV)

d) Database (DB)

e) Statistics (S)

The projects contained on this repository are the following:

1) Titanic (DC + ML + DV): this is a project on the Titanic Dataset. The purpose of the project is to use ML techniques to predict wheather a passenger would die or not, based on their characteristics.
2) dcleaning (DC + DB): this a project on a Academy Awards dataset. The purpose is to clean the data, normalize it and add it to SQLite DB.
3) imputsim (S + DC): this a project on a dataset acquired through a set of surveys. The purpose of the project is to simulate additional answers without misrepresenting the population.
